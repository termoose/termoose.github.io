Some text in this example post.

But the sad fact is that I just don’t have the time for it. A couple of weeks ago, I was merrily writing Java code. Then, I goofed something up, somehow, and found my Eclipse IDE completely inoperable for several days. Desperate to maintain my momentum with Java but unable to use Eclipse, I installed Netbeans and tried a tutorial that I’d recently done in Eclipse using Netbeans. As I did it, I realized that the developer of that tutorial might appreciate having a version of the tutorial that had Netbeans instructions. I contacted him and he encouraged me to do so but warned me that the technique he’d used for the original tutorial was no longer practical because the technology had been abandoned. He suggested using Hugo instead. I think he may have been under the belief that I did not know how to build a website myself. In point of fact, I’ve been building websites with HTML and CSS for 20 years now. But I thought I’d have a quick look at Hugo to see if there might be some productivity advantages to using it. Instead, I have problem after problem with it.
